Many of the original members have gone on to become professional artists and the group now attracts many high calibre ceramicists and artists in other media. We hold joint exhibitions, and organise workshops and seminars where notable craftspeople are invited to demonstrate their talents.

                                There are currently 21 members in the group, many of whom have lectured and taught locally, together with others who simply have a passion for their craft. Members meet frequently to plan events and share their expertise and genuine enthusiasm for the arts. The Barnet Collection continues to support various charities and has donated a considerable sum to many worthwhile causes.</p>
