Sandra Barnett is a clayworker, a sculptress, a ceramic artist, a potter. These descriptions cover the many aspects of her work. She is also an innovator, teacher, collector and perpetual student. Some of her work is figurative , which stems from her original training in illustration at St Martins School of Art in London, however much of her output has a humorous content, often with a play on words, i.e. Teatime Pole, and Graffi'tea' Pot She exhibits widely and has work in collections in the USA, Switzerland, and Israel.

Medal winner in City and Guilds, and twice a prize winner at London Potters Open Exhibition. “I usually work in batches of similar pieces allowing development within the ideas, but I feel the change between the different aspects of my work help me to maintain a freshness in the pieces I produce, which might otherwise become boring and stiff.”
