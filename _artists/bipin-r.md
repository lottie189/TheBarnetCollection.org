Bipin is a Graphic Designer with an interest in good design in ceramics, which led to him taking up Pottery in the late nineties, as a spare time pastime. He pots in a tiny studio at Home, making good basic, thrown, functional pottery. Shapes are kept simple but strong with positive rims, handles and flowing curves, using as few tools as possible other than hands to keep the shape as pure as possible.

Bipin works in Stoneware, and also makes one-off decorative Raku-fired pieces.
