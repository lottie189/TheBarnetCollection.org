I was born in Paris and moved to London 30 years ago and now living in Barnet. I am translating English books and in my spare time I am doing pottery at the institute and also sculpture.

I was introduced to pottery, by a friend,10 years ago and since it has become a great passion. I enjoy making different styles from classic pots to modern ones.

My sculptures are mainly contemporary.
