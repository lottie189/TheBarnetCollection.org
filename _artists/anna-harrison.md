Began making pots over twenty years ago, studying at Barnet College for the City and Guilds (Ceramics), Parts 1 and 2. She now works from her home studio, producing functional thrown stoneware, glazed and fired in an electric kiln.

Annaâ€™s recent work has included self-contained fountains and outdoor chess pieces. Other work is smoke-fired burnished pots, carefully made with attention to curve and shape.

Anna has exhibited widely, and sells from home and exhibitions.
