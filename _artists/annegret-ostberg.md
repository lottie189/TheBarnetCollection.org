Annegret has been making ceramics since 1980, studying at Barnet College, gaining City and Guilds Diplomas, 1 and 2. Her work has been influenced by the work of Lucy Rie, and the shapes of ancient European and Chinese wares,this interest being reflected in the simple, clear lines of her beautifully thrown pots.

She uses white stoneware clay, and high-fired blue or black glazes.

Her work has been included in exhibitions in London, Paris and Hungary.
