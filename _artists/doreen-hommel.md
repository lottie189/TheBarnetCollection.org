Born in South Africa, Doreen has lived in London since 1974. After studying ceramics in South Africa she attended the Camden Arts Centre, furthering her ceramic studies under the tutelage of Mo Abdullah. Currently works at Holmes Road, Kentish Town.
Most of her work is thrown functional (plates, bowls etc) and decorative ware ( mainly Raku fired). The shapes are much influenced by African pots and forms, harking back to her South African roots.

She has exhibited in London and south Africa, and has pieces in private collections in England, South Africa and America.
